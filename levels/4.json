The two oldest machines in maintenance (ID 37, ID 49, both installed Aug 2021) show different recent histories. Machine 37 had routine checks, updates, and calibration recently. Machine 49's history shows older events including failed calibration and part replacement, suggesting potentially more severe or persistent issues.",
          "intervention_suggestion": "For Machine 49, given its age, history of failed part replacement and calibration issues, and current 'Maintenance' status, prioritize a thorough diagnostic assessment rather than attempting further routine calibration or software updates. Focus on identifying the root cause of the previous failures before attempting further repairs."

Calculate the age of each machine as of 2025-01-01 based on `installation_date`. 3. Calculate the average age for 'Active' and 'Maintenance' groups. 4. Identify machines with `status='Maintenance'`. 5. Sort these maintenance machines by age (descending). 6. For the top 2 oldest, extract their last 3 maintenance records (sort maintenance records by date descending, take top 3). 7. Analyze the actions and notes in these recent records for common themes or issues. 8. Suggest an intervention for one machine based on its history."
