**D.A.T.A. Benchmarking: Build Consistency. Elevate Confidence.**

**Proposal: LLM Benchmarking Framework** 

---

### **1\. EXECUTIVE PERSPECTIVE & SUMMARY**

The LLM Benchmarking Framework offers an advanced solution for evaluating Language Learning Models (LLMs) within deterministic API workflows. This solution ensures seamless interaction with enterprise data, maintaining both accuracy and compliance.

Our proposal outlines a structured pilot project to develop a benchmarking framework that incorporates API access controls, multi-source data retrieval, and progressive testing across Finance, HR, and Operations. The system measures LLM performance based on accuracy, latency, and compliance, providing valuable insights.

The solution will be deployed on Heroku, leveraging Python-based AI agent workflows and the open Model Context Protocol (MCP), and shall work for both online API based closed-source, as well as open-source LLMs, with clear pathways for future production-grade enhancements.

### **3\. ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTIONS & COMPONENTS**

**![A diagram of a computer processAI-generated content may be incorrect.][image2]**

The system comprises seven core components:

1. **Data Layer**:  
   * **Structured Data**: PostgreSQL databases for enterprise data (e.g., Finance, HR, Operations tables with schemas).  
   * **Unstructured Data**: MongoDB collections for documents (e.g., quarterly reports, maintenance logs, customer comments and product reviews).  
2. **API Layer (DreamFactory)**:  
   * RESTful endpoints for structured/unstructured data, with RBAC-enforced access (e.g., /finance/revenue, /hr/policies).  
   * Filters for document retrieval (e.g., product\_id, machine\_id, customer\_id etc.).  
3. **RBAC & Governance**:  
   * Role-based API keys (HR, Finance, Operations) with granular access controls.

4. **MCP Server Layer (Model Context Protocol Servers for tool definitions on top of DreamFactory)**  
   * One or more MCP Servers containing tool definitions for DreamFactory API

5. **Test Runner Application**:  
   * Python-based AI agent orchestrator that converts user queries into API call plans, validates responses, and computes scores.  
   * This application will also act as MCP client.  
6. **LLM Inference Server**:  
   * Heroku-deployed server based on [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) hosting open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral) for benchmarking.  
7. **Evaluation & Monitoring**:  
   * [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) integration for test case management, logging, and performance tracking.

---

### **4\. DESCRIPTION OF KEY COMPONENTS**

1. **Enterprise Database Schema**:  
   * Simplified relational schemas for structured data (e.g., sales, employees, inventory tables) and MongoDB documents (e.g., policy\_docs, maintenance logs).  
2. **DreamFactory API Endpoints**:  
   * Predefined endpoints with RBAC (e.g., Finance users can access /finance/\* but not /hr/salaries).

3. **MCP Server Layer **

   * Tool definitions and descriptions for each DreamFactory Rest-API endpoint as callable Python functions.

     

   

4. **Test Cases**:  
   * 20-25 queries per department (Finance, HR, Operations) graded by difficulty (Levels 1–4 with at least 5 per level) with ground-truth answers.  
5. **Test Runner Agent**:  
   * Uses [**Pydantic AI**](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) for structured API call planning and [**Smolagents**](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index) for LLMs lacking native tool-calling support.  
6. **Scoring Engine**:  
   * Implements the formula: Score \= (2 \* Accuracy \+ 1 \* Performance) \- Penalties, with automated validation against ground truth.

* Generate granular reports (query-difficulty level and department-wise scores).

**Phase 3: Experiments for Improvements (1 Week)**
